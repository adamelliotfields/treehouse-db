### About this Course

In SQL Basics weâ€™ll take a look at what databases are and how you can retrieve information from them. Databases can store massive amounts of information to be retrieved at a later date. Databases act as the memory for dynamic web sites or mobile apps.  

### Instructions

I created these files so you can follow along with the course on your own computer in Terminal or pgAdmin.  

I highly recommend installing PostgreSQL using Homebrew. It will initialize your database cluster in `/usr/local/var/postgres` and you can run `brew services start postgresql` to start/stop your database server.  

This is not a definitive guide to using PostgreSQL, so I'd recomend checkout out [PostgreSQL Tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com) if you're not familiar with how to use it.  

*Import using SQL dump files*  

1.  Download and extract the [zip](https://github.com/adamelliotfields/treehouse-db/raw/master/sql-basics/sql-basics.zip).
2.  Use your text editor to find and replace my name (`adamfields`) with your PostgreSQL username (will be your OSX username if you installed using Homebrew)
3.  Run `psql` at the command line and connect to the database you want to import to
4.  Enter `\i /path/to/file.sql`
